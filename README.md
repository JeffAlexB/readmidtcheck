## Project Overview
This interactive machine learning application predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. It uses a trained Random Forest model calibrated on synthetic healthcare data to provide:

- A **numerical risk score** (0.00 to 1.00)
- A corresponding **risk tier** (Low, Medium, High)

The interface was built using Jupyter Notebook and `ipywidgets`, and is designed for ease-of-use by clinicians or hospital staff.

---

## Purpose

Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable. This tool provides a **decision-support aid** to help healthcare professionals identify patients at risk of early readmission and improve follow-up care planning.

---

## Features

- Input form with sliders and dropdowns for patient info (age, comorbidities, procedures, etc.)
- Prediction output: risk score and tier label
- Data visualizations:
  - Predicted score distribution by outcome
  - Risk tier breakdown
  - Feature importance analysis
- Synthetic test cases for model behavior analysis
- Final summary + discussion of results, limitations, and future work
